= Conventional Commits


== Conventional Commits
A specification like https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/[Conventional-Commits] can help to have a more uniform commit-history and enables you to generate versions depending on the commit title.
E.g. commit contains "fix: " as a prefix, then increment the patch-version
