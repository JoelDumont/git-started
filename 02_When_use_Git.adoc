== 🔥 Summary: Which One Should You Use?
✅ **Use Git** → Best for general development, DevOps, open source. +
✅ **Use SVN** → If you need a simple centralized system (easier for non-developers). +
✅ **Use Mercurial** → If you want Git-like features with a simpler UI. +
✅ **Use Perforce** → If you're handling **huge repositories** (AAA games, VFX). +
✅ **Use Fossil** → If you need an **all-in-one** version control + wiki + bug tracking system. +
✅ **Use Sapling** → If you're managing large monorepos (Meta-scale projects, with better merge and commit performance than Git). +
✅ **Use GVFS** → If you're working with large Git-based monorepos (Microsoft's solution for scaling Git with virtualized file systems). +
✅ **Use Bazel** → If you need fast, reproducible builds in large monorepos (Google's tool, works with Git and other VCS). +
