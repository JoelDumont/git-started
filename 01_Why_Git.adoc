= Why use GIT

Git is the most widely used **version control system (VCS)**, essential for software development, collaboration, and tracking changes efficiently. Here’s why you should use Git:

== Manual versioning

Who doesn't know it. One creates a new document and save a V1 to make sure we don't lose anything we previously worked on. Then V2 and so on.

Some operationg systems or applications provide *basic version tracking* out of the box like:

* Apple Time Machine (Creates snapshots of file versions on macOS)
* Windows File History (Automatically saves previous versions of files)
* ZFS /Btrfs Snapshots (Filesystem-level versioning used in servers)

✅ Works without extra software +
✅ Automatic backups

❌ Limited collaboration features +
❌ No branching/merging +
❌ No comment what changed +
❌ System decides in which time interval a change is added to the history

== Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCS)

// Todo: add logos
Classical examples are *SVN(Subversion)* or *TFS(Team Foundation Server)*
Unlike Git (a Distributed VCS), these systems rely on a centralized server to store versions.
One argument to use CVCS would be if you have to handle many binary files, because GIT every change in a binary file is stored *as a full new copy, not as a diff.*

✅ Simpler for large teams +
✅ Fine-grained access control +
✅ Easier binary file handling (Git is optimized for text-based files)

❌ Single point of failure +
❌ requires connection to the internet +
❌ Slower branching/merging compared to Git


== Cloud-Based Versioning Solutions

// Todo: add logos
Cloud based versioning tools like the one from *Microsoft-365 Word* or *Google Drive Docs* are helpful to keep track of what changed but are far away from whats possible with git.

✅ Great for non-coders (UI-based) +
✅ Automatic versioning +
✅ Easy collaboration

❌ No branching/merging +
❌ Limited control over commit history +
❌ no fast comparison between two version +
❌ requires connection to the internet +
❌ No comment what changed +
❌ System decides in which time interval a change is added to the history
