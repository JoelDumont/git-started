= Git Areas Explained

In **Git**, there are three main **areas** where changes can exist in a repository:

== ðŸ”¹ 1. Working Directory (Untracked & Modified Files)

ðŸ“Œ **What is it?**
- The **working directory** (or working tree) is where you make changes to files.
- Any modified or newly created files exist **only in your local copy** of the repository.

ðŸ“Œ **How to check?**
[source,sh]
----
git status
----
- Files listed as **"modified"** or **"untracked"** are in the **working directory**.

ðŸ“Œ **Example:**
[source,sh]
----
echo "Hello World" > file.txt  # Create a new file
git status  # Shows "Untracked files: file.txt"
----

---

== ðŸ”¹ 2. Staging Area (Index)

ðŸ“Œ **What is it?**
- The **staging area** (also called the **index**) is where Git tracks changes you intend to commit.
- Before committing, files must be **added to the staging area** using `git add`.

ðŸ“Œ **How to move files to staging?**
[source,sh]
----
git add file.txt  # Moves file.txt to staging
----

ðŸ“Œ **Check staged files:**
[source,sh]
----
git status
----
- Files in the **staging area** appear as **"Changes to be committed"**.

ðŸ“Œ **Example:**
[source,sh]
----
git add file.txt
git status
# Shows "Changes to be committed: file.txt"
----

---

== ðŸ”¹ 3. Git Repository (Committed History)

ðŸ“Œ **What is it?**
- The **Git repository** (also called **.git directory**) stores committed changes **permanently**.
- Commits are saved as snapshots and linked to previous commits.

ðŸ“Œ **How to commit staged files?**
[source,sh]
----
git commit -m "Added file.txt"
----
- Now the change is saved in the **repository history**.

ðŸ“Œ **Check commit history:**
[source,sh]
----
git log --oneline
----

ðŸ“Œ **Example:**
[source,sh]
----
git commit -m "Added file.txt"
git log --oneline
# Shows latest commit with ID and message
----

---

== ðŸ”¥ Example Workflow

[source,sh]
----
echo "Hello World" > file.txt  # Create file
git status  # Shows untracked file (Working Directory)
